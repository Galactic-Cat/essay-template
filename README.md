# Essay Template
For my university studies I write a lot of $\LaTeX$ documents. I figured I might just create this template to help me out, as I'm always looking back at old documents on how to start again.

## Template

The template is currently as followed:

1. Document class: article
   * Font size: 11pt

   * *amsmath* for math equations
   * *babel* (default english)
   * *graphicx* for images and such
   * utf8 *inputenc*
3. Title (default "Title")
4. Author (default "Author")
5. Date (default `\today`)
6. Begin of the document and `\maketitle`
